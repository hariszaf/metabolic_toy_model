# Introduction in metabolic modeling

## Topics to be discussed

We will cover some first topics regarding the metabolic modeling reconstruction and
some typical methods for their constraint-based analysis (CBA). 

Some concepts of CBA will be covered too.

The agenda is indicative and it will be shapes in real-time based on how we deal with the metabolic modeling challenges. :rocket:


## How to work with this repo 

You can either clone this repo by: 


    git clone https://github.com/hariszaf/metabolic_toy_model.git
    cd metabolic_toy_model

and jump to the `duth` branch:

    git checkout duth


**or**, you can fire a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces). 


> In both cases, you may follow the instructions you will find in the [`pre_env.ipynb`](./prep_env.ipynb) notebook!
